# TnKstore 
### [view demo](http://tnkstorev2.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/)
A personal e-commerce full stack project for presentation purposes only.

STACK: React, nodejs, express, Mongodb.

* Developed a fully functional e-commerce store with react, Nodejs and Mongodb.
* Implemented server side api endpoints for pagination, filtering and cart handling. 
* implemented client side facets while managing state through redux and  redux-thunk.
* Used Mongodb for database management which proved to be powerful in a one-to-many relationship.
* Implemented a fully functional and synced cart component.
* Took advantage of mongodb object-like nature to sync client side objects with their respective database objects without having to implement a separate api endpoint for each CRUD event.
