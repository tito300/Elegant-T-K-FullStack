# Elegant-T-K-FullStack


## Status: Pending.


This is a full stack store website project currently under development. This project will have two branches. The first is built using pure JS to demonstrate pure JS DOM manipulation. The second uses React to present React skills. Both branches use MongoDB for database storage and mongoose for modeling data. They both use Nodejs for the back end server.  

To run project on your machine please follow these steps:

1- make sure mongoDB is installed and start a mongod server in a separate terminal using 'mongod' command

> ..fileDirectory>mongod

2- run seeder to add data to database: 
> node seed/seeder.js

3- run the application: 
> npm start

4- visit localhost:3001
